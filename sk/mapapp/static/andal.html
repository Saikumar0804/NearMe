    The Srivilliputhur Andal Temple in Srivilliputhur, a town in Virudhunagar district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, is dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu. 
    It is located 80 km from Madurai.
    Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture,
    the temple is glorified in the Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Alvar saints from the 6thâ€“9th centuries CE.
    It is one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Vatapatrasayi and his consort Lakshmi as Andal.
    It is believed to be the birthplace of two of the Alvars, namely Periyalvar and his foster-daughter, Andal.
